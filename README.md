# Briefly About Me

I am a Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science student from Johns Hopkins University guaduating 2018 summer, and I am actively seeking any job or interview opportunities. 

## Resume
This is my [**resume**](resume/my-resume.pdf). It's brief and covers basically everything including my school performance (GPA 3.75 in JHU so far) and a list of courses I have taken. It includes my [Github](https://github.com/vegito2002) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiang-zhang-855615117/) address.

It's worth mentioning that aside from pragmatic interview preparation, I have also taken additional time to re-whet my **database**, **computer networking** and **operating system** basic knowledge. 

If you have an interview opportunity but requires a Cover Letter, feel free to contact me in any form listed here and I will respond promptly.

## Programming Interview Preparation
I have been actively practicing on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/vegito2002gmailcom/) and have been participating in LeetCode weekly contests. My highest global rank in history is 1703 / 43575:

I have finished so far **417 / 722** (ever increasing) algorithmic problems so far (*this number is more updated than that shown in the picture above*).   
I have to stress that I not only put significant effort into practicing my own skills on algorithmic design and analysis, but also value communicating my ideas with other competitive coders. Currently I have earned ** â˜…171 ** reputation (ever growing) in the LeetCode discuss community, as shown in [this post](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/discuss/115490/JAVA-Adapted-Dijkstra's-algorithm-solution:-easy-and-explained).

This is a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUy2JJZHuVxMAboYnXP9DME6kX-3EpBTuOPloZ1RfY0/edit#gid=786068196) that includes tracking information for part of my LeetCode practicing. 

I did not major in Computer Science in my undergraduate program, but I make up for my lack of experience with diligence during my Master's program in CS. Up till this moment, I have spent more than 700 hours on LeetCode, with throughly taken notes kept in this [**Gitbook**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/vegito2002/leetcode-notes/details).
