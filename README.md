# Briefly About Me

I am a Master of Science in Engineering student from Johns Hopkins University guaduating 2018 summer, and am actively seeking any job or interview opportunities. It includes my [Github](https://github.com/vegito2002) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiang-zhang-855615117/) address.

## Resume
This is my [**resume**](resume/my-resume.pdf). It's brief and covers basically everything including my school performance (GPA 3.74 in JHU so far) and a list courses I have taken.

## Programming Interview Preparation
I have been actively practicing on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/vegito2002gmailcom/) and have participated in several contests:

This is a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUy2JJZHuVxMAboYnXP9DME6kX-3EpBTuOPloZ1RfY0/edit#gid=786068196) that includes tracking information for part of my LeetCode practicing. 

I did not major in Computer Science in my undergraduate program, but I make up for my lack of experience with diligence. Up till this moment, I have spent more than 700 hours on LeetCode, with throughly taken notes kept in this [**Gitbook**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/vegito2002/leetcode-notes/details).

## Currently Working On
Currently I am
* recapping knowledge about basics including Databases and Operating System.
* self-learning System Design.
* learning to build a Spring and Hibernate based Web project to whet my industrial aptitude.
